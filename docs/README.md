## **Core Gameplay**

1. **Mint Town NFT**  
   Players begin by minting a unique town (Ville NFT). Each town serves as the foundation for resource generation and strategic gameplay.

2. **Build Resource NFTs**  
   Players construct resource-generating buildings (e.g., wood mills, stone quarries, energy plants) to gather essential materials for progression.

3. **Mint Gold Mining NFTs**  
   Use gathered resources to create gold mining units, which convert resources into gold, the primary in-game currency.

4. **Strategic Army Units**  
   Gold is used to mint army units. Players deploy these units for defense or to invade other towns.

5. **Marketplace**  
   Trade resources and gold with other players to optimize your strategy.

6. **Invasions**  
   Players can invade other towns to claim a percentage of unclaimed resources and gold. This introduces a layer of strategic competition.

## **Energy System**

- **Energy Cap:** Limits actions a player can perform. Energy recharges over time.
- **Gold Boost:** Instantly recharge energy using gold or BNB.
- **Referral Rewards:** Inviting new players increases your energy cap.

## **Ownership and Transfer**

- Buildings are permanently tied to their respective towns (Ville NFTs).
- Resources, gold, and army units are managed by the current owner of the town.
- Ville owners receive a **30% share token**, representing their stake. This token can be split or transferred to divide resource and gold collection rights.

## **Blockchain Optimizations**

### **Multi-Contract Architecture**

To minimize gas fees and optimize functionality, the game employs modular smart contracts:

1. **Core Contracts:**

   - TownNFT for managing Ville ownership and transfers.
   - EnergySystem for handling energy cap and recharge mechanics.

2. **Building Contracts:**

   - ResourceNFT for minting and managing resource-generating buildings.
   - GoldMiningNFT for creating gold mining structures.

3. **Army Contracts:**

   - ArmyNFT for minting and managing army units.
   - Invasion logic to handle battles and resource claims.

4. **Marketplace Contract:**

   - Facilitates player-to-player trading of resources and gold.

5. **Ville Shares Contract:**
   - Facilitates the sale and distribution of 30% shares of Ville ownership, enabling profit sharing of resources and gold among share owners.
